# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the dashboard header and footer copy/styling and clarify the chart legend labeling for the dashed CSV temperature series.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the footer credit pill/link text with plain centered text: “Built by Hannes @Petersime”, removing any “Built with love using” and “caffeine.ai” wording.
- Apply accent color #65714B more prominently within the TemperatureDashboardPage header/title bar while keeping layout and readability intact.
- Update the header subtitle under “Conceptmachine Live Data” to: “Updated every 10 min”.
- Update the chart legend text so the “Temperature CSV (°F)” entry explicitly indicates it is a dashed line, while keeping the filtered series labeling unchanged in meaning.

**User-visible outcome:** The dashboard shows the updated footer credit, a header that incorporates the #65714B accent color, a new subtitle (“Updated every 10 min”), and a legend that clearly marks the CSV temperature line as dashed.
