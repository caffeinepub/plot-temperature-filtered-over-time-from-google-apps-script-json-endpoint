# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “CO2 Right (%)” series visually distinct by rendering it in a lighter green than “CO2 Left (%)”, consistently in both the chart and legend.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the CO2 chart series styling so “CO2 Left (%)” uses a darker green and “CO2 Right (%)” uses a lighter green.
- Ensure the legend swatches match the same darker/lighter green colors used for the corresponding chart lines.
- Apply the same relative color contrast (Right lighter than Left) in both light mode and dark mode.

**User-visible outcome:** In the CO2 chart, users can clearly differentiate “CO2 Left (%)” (dark green) from “CO2 Right (%)” (light green) in both the chart lines and the legend, across light and dark themes.
