  "summary": "Dashboard app that fetches time-series JSON data from a Google Apps Script endpoint and visualizes Temperature (Filtered & CSV) and CO₂ (Right/Left/CSV) over a shared timestamp axis (synced zoom/pan), with a professional card-based layout (light mode default, optional dark mode) using accent color #65714B. Header should show title only (no logo). CO₂ scaling: keep CO2 CSV as (%) and scale CO2 Rechts/Links by x0.001 so all three CO₂ series are in (%).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Data source is a Google Apps Script web app returning a JSON array of objects.",
    "Chart x-axis uses ISO timestamp field \"Timestamp\"; y-axis uses \"Temperature Filtered(F)\".",
    "Numeric values may be strings using comma as decimal separator (e.g., \"71,86\") and must be parsed accordingly.",
    "Chart should use a fixed Y-axis domain of 70°F to 102°F for temperature visualization.",
    "Incoming JSON now uses a different structure; \"Timestamp\" is provided in a non-ISO string format (e.g., \"10/02/26 10:42:57\") and must be parsed accordingly.",
    "JSON endpoint includes CO₂ fields \"CO2 Rechts\", \"CO2 Links\", and \"CO2 CSV(%)\" in the same array objects as temperature data.",
    "Dashboard will include two full-width chart cards (Temperature and CO₂) stacked vertically, sharing the same time axis domain.",
    "Chart interactions should support click-drag/scroll zoom with a synchronized time-range state applied to all charts; light mode default with optional dark mode.",
    "Remove all logo functionality/assets from the UI; header displays title only (no logo image, no logo fallback text).",
    "CO₂ units/scaling: keep \"CO2 CSV(%)\" as-is (no x10000 ppm conversion); multiply \"CO2 Rechts\" and \"CO2 Links\" by 0.001 so all three CO₂ series are in (%) on the chart."

    "UI bug: card/plot title bar tint is only applied to part of the header area; should span the full title bar.",
